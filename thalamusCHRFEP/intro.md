##Introduction
Disrupted thalamo-cortical connectivity is regarded as one of the core psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. However, whether the thalamo-cortical white matter connectivity is disrupted before the onset of psychosis is still unknown. To determine this gap in knowledge, the extent of thalamo-cortical white matter connection changes in subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR) was compared to that of subjects diagnosed with first episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls. 


##Methods
A total of 38 UHR, 22 FEP and 37 matched healthy controls underwent diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to examine the number of probabilistic tractography between thalamus and eight parcellated cortical regions representing white matter connectivity. We also investigated the relationship between white matter connectivity and psychopathology.



##Results
 For FEP, the connectivity between the thalamus and parietal cortex was significantly increased compared to that of healthy controls. However, the connectivity between thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex was considerably reduced compared to that of both healthy controls and UHR. Interestingly, UHR exhibited a similar pattern as FEP when comparing the thalamic connectivity to healthy controls with slightly reduced magnitude. There was a notable escalation in thalamo-parietal pathway but a substantial decrease in thalamo-orbitofrontal connectivity. Also, the thalamo-orbitofrontal connection was correlated with the general Global Assessment of Functioning score in UHR. 

##Discussion
This unbalanced pattern of the white matter connection in psychosis and in the prodromal stage suggests this change, clearly observed in UHR, could be utilized as a possible marker for the early detection of psychosis.
