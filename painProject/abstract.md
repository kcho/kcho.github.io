##Objectives

The alteration of brain structure caused by chronic pain remains controversial and alteration of prefrontal function is poorly understood. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare and chronic distressing pain disorder. It causes many neuropsychiatric disorders and general disability. However, there are few studies about which specific sub-regions in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are involved in CRPS. In the present study, we analyzed cortical thickness to investigate whether there were differences of local morphologic brain alterations between CRPS and healthy control subjects (HCs), and also evaluated clinical correlation between cortical thickness and neurocognitive functions.

##Methods

Cortical thickness analyses from MRI data have been developed and cortical thickness in different regions reflects the size, density, and arrangement of cells. This study included 3T, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 25 patients with CRPS and 25 normal controls. Cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer method which is automated analysis of key features in the human brain. Pain severity and Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using SFMPQ and BDI, BAI respectively. To assess the neurocognitive function, Wisconsin card sorting test, Stop-signal task was performed. A correlation analysis between neuropsychological test and cortical thickness was conducted.

##Results
Significant thickness reduction was shown in the right rostral middle frontal lobe and left inferior frontal lobe in CRPS patients compared with HCs. Significant difference were shown in WSCT and SST between two groups. The cortical thickness reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) correlated with Stop-Signal Task (SST). There is no significant result in BDI, BAI.

##Conclusion
Our study suggests that pathophysiology of CRPS may relate with reduced thickness. DLPFC have been investigated as a region that responsible for not only executive function like working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning but also pain perception. Decreased thickness in DLPFC may essential pathology related with disinhibited pain perception and modulation in CRPS. A number of neuroimaging findings have been interpreted as evidence that the left inferior frontal gyrus(IFG) play key role in retrieval of semantic knowledge and inhibitory control over motor responses. Combined these results, these structural alterations may explain the executive dysfunction and disinhibited pain perception in CRPS and these are one of the possible pathophysiology in CRPS.
